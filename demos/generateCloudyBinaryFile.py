# as the input ionizing source.
# 1. Write an ascii file in Cloudy format with grid
#    of FSPS spectra in all available ages and
#    metallicities
# 2. Compile asii file into binary format required
#    for Cloudy use. Assumes $CLOUDY_EXE is set to
#    your /path/to/cloudy.exe
# 3. Writes Cloudy input files for a subset of grid
#    parameters.
# 4. Runs Cloudy on the *.in files
# 5. Formats the various output files
